## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Spring Boot API with Maven, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can check if Java is installed by running `java -version` in your terminal. If it's not installed, download and install it from the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

2. **Maven Build Tool:** Maven is the build tool for your project. Make sure you have Maven installed. You can check your Maven installation by running `mvn -version`. If it's not installed, follow the installation instructions for Maven at [Maven Installation Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

3. **Spring Boot Application:** You should have your Spring Boot application source code and configuration files ready. Ensure that your application is set up and ready to run with Maven.

4. **Terminal or IDE:** You will need access to a terminal to execute Maven commands for building and running your Spring Boot application or IDE like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download/).

Make sure to meet these prerequisites before running and using your Spring Boot API with Maven.
